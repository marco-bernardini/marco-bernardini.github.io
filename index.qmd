# Welcome

Hi, I'm Marco, a macroeconomics researcher with a passion for data, math, and programming. This year, I'll be working as a consultant for SDG Group in Milan, where I’ll be helping banks and insurance companies develop ML and AI models. When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me enjoying endurance sports, mountaineering, or spending quality time with my two poodles, [Joyce](images/joyce.jpg) and [Leyla](images/leyla.jpg).
